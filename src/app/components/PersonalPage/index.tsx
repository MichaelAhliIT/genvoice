                  I'm a Junior Website Developer. My projects usually use NextJS
                  or ReactJS and Tailwind CSS. I like to add a little animation
                  effect using AnimeJS. Hope you guys like my works.

For my thesis, I developed a text classification system using Support Vector Machines (SVM). During my internship, I worked on developing a chatbot for automating customer service tasks. Besides that, I just created some personal website for my portfolio. I use React when I intern and i use NextJS for my thesis. at first, i don't know backend at all, even the very simple one. but my thesis requires me to make some backend and i learn about expressjs and next api. my first database is mongodb because it is very easy to use and a non-relational database. after that, i learn about another database such as Redis and Amazon DynamoDB."

The leads score determines how likely a user is to be converted into a sale. I analyzed several classification algorithms, including Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, SVM, and Naive Bayes. I used the scikit-learn library, adjusting the hyperparameters accordingly. The main challenge was that my dataset was quite small (around 1,000 entries). However, the results showed that SVM performed the best, with an average accuracy of over 80%."

However, Iâ€™m also comfortable handling backend tasks when necessary. During my thesis, I developed a keen interest in AI, particularly chatbots, finding the experience both fun and rewarding. It sparked my curiosity about AI's potential to automate tasks and enhance user experiences."
